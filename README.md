#**Machine Learning**
In this project, we tried to apply the three machine-learning classification techniques
Linear regression, Logistic regression, and Naive Bayes to the mnist, BBC, and weather data set.

 #**Tools**
- Python was used for development.
- The mnist data set was acquired from the tensor flow, a machine learning platform
- BBC and weather data sets were retrieved from CSV files.
- matplotlib was used to prepare the graphs that depicted the accuracy level of each classification technique
  for different parameters.

#**How to use**
1. Clone this repository to your local machine. `git clone nahom4/Ai`
2. Open the folder in a code editor.
3. install tensor flow `pip install tensorflow`.
4. install mathplotlib `pip install mathplotlib`.
5. Run the code.
